This archive contains two executable files:
 - bochs32.exe
 - bochs64.exe

They are the compiled Windows executable of the Bochs (USB Edition) emulator found at:

  https://github.com/fysnet/Bochs-USB-Edition

The file with '32' is for 32-bit Windows, while the other is
for a 64-bit Windows platform.  They are complied with VS2019,
version 16.11.30.

These files are for those users that do not have a way to compile the source
and are just looking for the compiled executables. They were compiled on the
date shown at the top of this readme file.

They are known to work on Windows10, though earlier versions of Windows might
work as well.

They might need the latest runtime libraries which are found at:
